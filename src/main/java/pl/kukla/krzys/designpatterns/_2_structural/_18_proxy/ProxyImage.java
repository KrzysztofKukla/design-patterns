/**
 * Similar to decorator
 * for Decorator we are adding additional functionality
 * for Proxy we wrapper object with any additional feature like lazy loading, access control etc.
 * Proxy is placeholder ( symbol zastepczy ), surrogate ( zastÄ™pstwo ) for real object
 * Proxy work around ( obchodzi ) real object
 * There are many reasons to use proxy - the most commons are
 * - lazy loading,
 * - access control
 * - auditing
 * - protection proxy - security - control access to original's operations - control which operation can be called on the real object and when
 * - remote proxy - provides local representation of remote object
 * - virtual proxy - delay of construction of object ( performance issue - construction is very expensive and takes long time ) until this is
 * really necessary
 * Client is completely unaware of existing of proxy, everything works transparently
 * Client bases on the same interface which can be proxy
 * examples of using proxy in real life:
 * - Lazy loading collection by Hibernate
 * - Spring feature like transaction management, caching, AOP ( Aspects ) support
 * - Spring Security
 * <p>
 * to provide proxy to the Client instead real object we use ProxyFactory
 * pay attention to the performance cost of using proxy and synchronization if our base object is Thread Safe
 * Synchronization for Proxy is not automatically even if our base object is synchronized
 * Decorator needs access to real object vs Proxy does not all the time
